Need to do:
- Include accessmap interface as shortcode option
- Simple map to use marker-layer object
- Include overlays in shortcode maps
- Pull image if linked to a post on same blog?
- Settings: Allow option to set default gps lat lng and zoom for admin map
- Settings: Set attribution
- Update'features shortcode' (currenly requires foundation for the layout)

Wishlist:
- All placemarks:  Sort locations into individual columns (link to just those like a real taxonomy)
- Group placemarks when zoomed out?
- Link selector (replace URL text field)
